## Features
`soundboard` is a simple keyboard driven soundboard that:

* Can be used with any key on your keyboard
* Can have a limitless number of bindings
* Can repeat audio clips with a single key press
* Can play most standard audio file formats
* Is easily configured through a JSON file
* Should work on any operating system

## Why

* I see a lot of streamers playing audio clips during their streams but most of them are on Windows, and can make use of things like an Elgato Stream Deck. Being a Linux user this isn't an option for me so this seemed like the simplest solution.

## Dependencies

* [pynput](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput) for keyboard input
* [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub) for generic audio playback

## Configuration
